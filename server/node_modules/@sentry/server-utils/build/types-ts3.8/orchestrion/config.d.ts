 * The central list of channel injections orchestrion should perform.
 *
 * This module has NO side effects — it's the only thing both the runtime hook
 * (`runtime/import-hook.mjs`) and the bundler plugins (`bundler/vite.ts`, …)
 * import from. Adding a new instrumented method is one entry here plus one
 * subscriber in `integrations/<lib>/tracing-channel.ts`.
 *
 * `channelName` here is the unprefixed suffix; the actual diagnostics_channel
 * name is `orchestrion:${module.name}:${channelName}` (see `channels.ts`).

 *
 * Bundler plugins MUST ensure these are actually bundled rather than
 * externalized: an externalized dependency is resolved from `node_modules` at
 * runtime and never passes through the code transform's `onLoad`, so its
 * diagnostics_channel calls are silently never injected.

 * uses an "external" denylist (esbuild, Bun, Rollup) still bundles — and thus
 * transforms — them. Matches an exact package name (`'mysql'`) or a subpath
 * (`'mysql/lib/...'`); wildcard/other patterns are left untouched. `undefined`
 * is returned unchanged.
 *
 * (Vite uses an `ssr.noExternal` allowlist instead, so it consumes
 * `INSTRUMENTED_MODULE_NAMES` directly rather than this helper.)
